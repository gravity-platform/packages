# Gravity-Platform Composer Packages

Repository of opensource [graviton](https://packagist.org/packages/graviton/graviton) bundles.

This is deployed by running ``composer run-script deploy`` and should be deployed after each
push and on pushes to the repos listed in ``satis.json``.

Until we sort out our continuous deploy issues it will be deployed manually to
[unstable](http://gravity-platform-packages-unstable.nova.scapp.io/).
